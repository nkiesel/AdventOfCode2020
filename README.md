# AdventOfCode2020

This is the code developed for [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).  My primary goals are:

  - have fun
  - learn something new about Kotlin
  - don't spend more than 1 hour each day
 
 I thus favor short and readable code over optimized code. As a rule of thumb, any code which finishes in under 1 minute
 is "good enough".  I also will not try to handle possible corner cases if the provided input file does not contain them.
 
 Every day contains 2 sub-problems.  The code is organized to use a file per day, and have a mostly standalone function
 for each of the 2 sub-problems.  The code is organized as unit tests to make it easier to document the expected result
 and also because that allows to run the functions directly in IntellJ.
